# undoing commits

git reset readme.cd --- undos the previous commit action done on the file readme.cd
git reset HEAD~1 --- HEAD command points the cursor to the last commit, and ~1 points it to before the commit thereby undoing the commit
git log --- shows you the commited actions in reverse chronological order - copy the hash from the commit from which you have to undo and then type:
git reset cd04839...(hash from git log)
git reset --hard cd939 (hash from git log) --- undoes commit as well as removes any changes made from that commit
